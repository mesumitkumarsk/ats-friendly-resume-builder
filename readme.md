# ATS-Friendly Resume Builder

This repository contains a Python script for generating an ATS-friendly PDF resume from user input. The script collects information such as education details, skills, work experience, projects, achievements, and other activities from the user via command-line input. It then converts this information into a Markdown format and uses an API to convert it into a PDF file styled with custom CSS.

## Features

- User-friendly command-line interface for inputting resume details.
- Supports multiple sections including education, skills, experience, projects, achievements, and activities.
- Custom CSS styling for the generated PDF.
- Uses a web API (`md-to-pdf.fly.dev`) for converting Markdown to PDF.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)
